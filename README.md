API_INFO

API_INFO is just a .py file in the root of this project where you should add two variables in the following manner. 
api_key ='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
api_secret='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'

This is generated from Binance. You would need to generate your own API key and secret and give it permission for margin trading.
